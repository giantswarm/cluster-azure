# cluster-azure

`cluster-azure` is a an app that helps create a CRs for a Cluster API Azure cluster for Giant Swarm platform.

## Configuration

See our [full list of configuration options](helm/cluster-azure/README.md).

## Maintaining `values.schema.json` and `values.yaml`

**tldr**:  
We only maintain `values.schema.json` and automatically generate `values.yaml` from it.
```
make normalize-schema
make validate-schema
make generate-values
```

**Details**:

In order to provide a better UX we validate user values against `values.schema.json`.
In addition we also use the JSON schema in our frontend to dynamically generate a UI for cluster creation from it.
To succesfully do this, we have some requirements on the `values.schema.json`, which are defined in [this RFC](https://github.com/giantswarm/rfc/pull/55).
These requirements can be checked with [schemalint](https://github.com/giantswarm/schemalint).
`schemalint` does a couple of things:

- Normalize JSON schema (indentation, white space, sorting)  
- Validate whether your schema is valid JSON schema
- Validate whether the requirements for cluster app schemas are met
- Check whether schema is normalized

The first point can be achieved with:
```
make normalize-schema
```
The second to fourth point can be achieved with:
```
make validate-schema
```


The JSON schema in `values.schema.json` should contain defaults defined with the `default` keyword.
These defaults should be same as those defined in `values.yaml`. 
This allows us to generate `values.yaml` from `values.schema.json` with:
```
make generate-values
```
